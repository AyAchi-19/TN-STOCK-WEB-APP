🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🚀

I’ve just completed a web application that combines technical stock analysis with AI-powered insights, and I’m thrilled about its potential in merging data science with real-world market analysis.

🔍 What It Does:

Data Processing: Upload and parse CSV files containing French-formatted stock data (semicolon delimiters, comma decimals, DD/MM/YYYY dates) to extract key financial metrics.
Technical Analysis: The tool calculates essential indicators like moving averages (50-day & 200-day) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to understand market trends.
AI Integration: Leveraging Google’s Gemini API, it generates professional market insights and risk assessments based on the latest data points.
Visualization: Built with Python, Matplotlib, and Flask, the app produces interactive charts and a modern, user-friendly interface for a seamless experience.
💡 Why It Matters:
This project is a perfect blend of machine learning, natural language processing, and financial analysis. It showcases how combining traditional technical indicators with AI can provide a comprehensive market outlook—empowering traders, analysts, and finance enthusiasts with actionable insights.

🛠 Technologies Used:

Python (data processing, analysis, and scripting)
TensorFlow (for potential future enhancements in machine learning models)
Flask (web app framework)
Matplotlib (data visualization)
Google’s Gemini API (AI-powered market insights)
I’m proud of the progress made and excited about the future developments this project could lead to. If you’re interested in discussing this further or have ideas for collaboration, let’s connect!
